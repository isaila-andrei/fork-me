Hey! This is Amena Najeeb. I have been an Online Tutor for over 4+ years now. We are working on an EdTech startup called Delta Sigma Technologies, we are located in Hyderabad.

I am a tech enthusiast. I like exploring new courses and working with new technologies. I am glad that I came across Tapas Adhikary's post on freedcodecamp.org that lead me to watch the Git Version Control playlist.

Thank you for your efforts, Sir!
